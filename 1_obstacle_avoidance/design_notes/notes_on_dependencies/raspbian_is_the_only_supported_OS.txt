The Grove.py and BrickPi3 repositories are designed to be installed in Raspbian (or Raspbian for Robots) only. 

Even though you can run the terminal commands in macOS (and maybe Windows), the install will fail.

The file dependencies branch out so far, you will encounter dependency hell if you try to link them yourself. So don't try it, just install on Raspbian for Robots. :)
